### Capstone Project Proposal: IP Scanning Tool for Network Insights  

#### Project Overview  
The **VulnByte** web-based application is a tool designed to help users quickly and easily scan a specific IP address for basic information. By providing options for both quick and full scans, the tool allows users to gather details such as the IP, MAC address, device name, and other essential data about the target. This functionality aids in improving network visibility and management.  

---

#### Problem Statement  
Many users lack the technical tools or expertise to analyze devices or identify key details within their network. This can lead to gaps in understanding and securing their networked devices.  

The **VulnByte** tool simplifies this process by offering straightforward scanning options. Users can perform quick or full scans of a target IP address to retrieve critical information, empowering them to take initial steps toward network awareness and management.  

---

### üåü Future Features  

As part of the project's roadmap, the following features are planned for implementation:  

- **Full Network Scans**: Use Nmap3 to scan and discover all devices on the user‚Äôs network, providing a complete overview of connected devices.  
- **Port Scanning**: Extend functionality to scan open ports on all devices, helping users identify potential vulnerabilities or security gaps.  
- **PDF Reporting**: Enable users to export scan results into professional PDF reports for record-keeping, analysis, or sharing with IT professionals.  

---

#### Curricular Areas and Requirements:

**Prototype (Two Curricular Areas)**  

1. **CIDM 6308: Seminar in Data Analytics**  
   - **Focus**: Implement statistical analysis and predictive modeling to evaluate network vulnerabilities and device details gathered from the scans.  
   - **Output**: A basic version of the tool that includes IP scanning, data collection, and visualization techniques for presenting scan results.  

2. **CIDM 6340: Networking Management and Information Security**  
   - **Focus**: Integrate scanning and vulnerability assessment components, utilizing cybersecurity tools to scan devices and identify network vulnerabilities.  
   - **Output**: A functioning prototype that demonstrates how the tool performs quick and full scans on a target IP and provides critical information about the networked devices.
